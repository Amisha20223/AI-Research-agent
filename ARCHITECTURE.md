    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant D as Database
    participant C as Celery
    participant E as External APIs

    U->>F: Submit research topic
    F->>A: POST /research
    A->>D: Store research topic
    A->>C: Queue background task
    A->>F: Return topic ID
    F->>U: Show submission confirmation

    C->>D: Update status to "processing"
    C->>E: Fetch articles from APIs
    E->>C: Return article data
    C->>C: Process and analyze content
    C->>D: Store results and logs
    C->>D: Update status to "completed"
\`\`\`

### Real-time Updates Flow
